## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Video Interface**: Real-time video capture and display
- **CV Detection Engine**: TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe integration
- **Event Dashboard**: Live monitoring and alerts
- **Reporting System**: Analytics and report generation

### Backend API
- **Session Management**: `/api/sessions` - Create and manage interview sessions
- **Event Logging**: `/api/events` - Log and retrieve detection events
- **Report Generation**: `/api/reports` - Generate comprehensive reports

### Detection Capabilities
- **Focus Tracking**: Detects when candidate looks away >5 seconds
- **Face Presence**: Alerts when no face detected >10 seconds
- **Multiple Faces**: Identifies additional people in frame
- **Object Detection**: Recognizes phones, books, papers, electronic devices

## 📊 Detection Thresholds

| Event Type | Threshold | Action |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| Looking Away | >5 seconds | Focus lost event logged |
| No Face Detected | >10 seconds | Absence event logged |
| Multiple Faces | Instant | Multiple person alert |
| Unauthorized Objects | Instant | Suspicious item alert |

## 🎯 Integrity Scoring

The system calculates an integrity score starting from 100 points with deductions for:

- **Focus Loss**: -2 points per incident
- **Extended Absence**: -5 points per incident  
- **Multiple Faces**: -10 points per incident
- **Unauthorized Items**: -15 points per item detected
- **Excessive Movement**: -3 points per incident

## 📈 Reporting Features

### Session Report Includes:
- Candidate information and session details
- Interview duration and timeline
- Focus statistics and attention metrics
- Suspicious event summary
- Final integrity score with breakdown
- Downloadable PDF/CSV formats

### Real-time Dashboard:
- Live detection status indicators
- Event log with timestamps
- Current integrity score
- Session controls and management

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
